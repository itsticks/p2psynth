# Peer to Peer Javascript Canvas moog mother synthesiser

I want to make a site where I can play a javascript clone of a moog sound studio synthesisers with all the same controls and patches. i want to be able to play it peer to peer with up to 3 friends. each person can select one of the 3 instruments of the mother to play at each time and they all interact over the patch bay, but everyone is hearing the same thing because all the settings are kept in sync over the network. anyone can change the patching as they please. we can make it so it just works with the first 3 people who connect to it, for now!

I want it to work well on a mobile phone as well as on desktop. the interface is on a html5 canvas but needs to work for touchscreen or mouse.

please make it all with html and javascript so i can deploy it to github pages
